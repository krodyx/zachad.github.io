<p>I want to start publishing some of my daily thoughts and discoveries while programming in Ruby. I've come to the conclusion that for the amount of time I spend in front of a project every day, there must be a tiny snippet that I can share with the world.  </p>

<p>They may not be in context.  They may jump around from subject to subject.  One day could be Ruby, the next Vim, the following something about building an RPM. But for myself to write things down and start seeing a history of what I've learned, and for others to stumble upon them and hopefully learn something, or turn around and teach me more, I have to give this a shot!</p>

<p>Step 1. Get Jekyll running on this thing!</p>
